IngreScan – Ingredient Awareness App

IngreScan is a barcode-based food awareness app designed to help people make informed choices about what they eat.
Unlike calorie or fitness trackers, IngreScan focuses on ingredient transparency and health impact:

📊 Health Score (1–10) – simple numeric rating of overall product healthiness.

🏷 Consumption Tier – Daily, Weekly, Occasional, or Avoid, for easy decision-making.

⚠ Smart Warnings – flags excess sugar, preservatives, stabilizers, and allergens.

👤 Personalized Feedback – adapts results based on user’s health profile (e.g., diabetes, allergies).

🥗 Ingredient Awareness – highlights what you’re really consuming, not just numbers on the nutrition label.

The goal: make food choices simpler, safer, and healthier by turning complex nutrition and ingredient data into clear, actionable insights.
